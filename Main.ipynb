    "Our company has decided to start a new movie studio to join the growing trend of original video content. However, we don’t have much experience in the film industry. To help guide this new venture, we were asked to research what kinds of movies are currently doing well at the box office.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores recent movie data to find out which film genres, release times, and other factors are most linked to success. We also look at things like budget, cast, and audience ratings to understand what makes a movie perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to turn this information into simple, clear insights and recommendations that the studio can use to decide what types of films to produce. By using real data, we aim to give the new movie studio a strong and smart starting point."

With major studios seeing success through data-driven content strategies, we aim to explore recent box office trends to identify which film genres, themes, and production strategies are currently performing best. Our insights will translate directly into actionable recommendations—enabling the studio to compete effectively in the modern entertainment landscape."

    "Missing Value Handling: Filled or removed rows with missing revenue, budget, or genre information depending on their importance and availability.\n",
    "Feature Engineering: Created new features such as ROI (Return on Investment), revenue-to-budget ratio, genre category simplification (e.g., \"Action/Adventure\", \"Drama\", \"Animation\").\n",

    "Genre Trends: Action, superhero, and animated films tend to dominate the box office. However, horror films often deliver high ROI due to low budgets.\n",
    "Release Timing: Summer and holiday season releases significantly outperform others.\n",
    "Budget vs. Revenue: While high-budget films usually earn more, several low-budget titles achieved remarkable profitability, particularly in horror and comedy.\n",
    "Ratings Correlation: Audience scores (especially IMDb) are moderately correlated with box office success, but star power and franchise status tend to have a stronger impact.\n",
    "Franchise Impact: Sequels and franchise films typically outperform standalone films, suggesting an appetite for continuity and established universes."

    "# Conclusion\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1) Certain Genres Make More Money\n",
    "Action, superhero, animation, and horror films are top performers. Horror movies in particular offer high profits even with small budgets, making them a smart choice for a new studio with limited risk.\n",
    "### 2) Timing Matters\n",
    "Movies released during peak seasons—like summer and holidays—tend to earn much more. Choosing the right release time can significantly boost a movie’s success.\n",
    "### 3) Franchises and Big Names Attract Audiences\n",
    "Films that are part of a series (franchises) or include famous actors or directors usually perform better, thanks to built-in fan bases and greater audience trust."
